Cities: Skylines 2 but better!

The goal is to makerusty skylines: A Cities: Skylines inspired game featuring more features and way better performance as a priority.
Modding is also a priority!

It currently features: 
A 3D scene with orbiting mechanics and movement of the camera.
A WIP GUI Editor with the ability to edit any GUI in-game and save it, allowing expressions and logic and animations to be available through modding. 
(I won't hard-code any GUI, I'll just use the same thing I provide as modding, therefore creating great modding support. Win-Win!)
All graphics are MSAA anti-aliased. (I didn't see a performance hit yet, but we'll see about that!)
