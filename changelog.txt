Rusty Skylines Alpha v1.0.2c

Made the holy square bigger real quick.
Fixed the advanced circle shader as well, with a now functioning glow effect, a border and inner filling, all controlled from the gui_layout.json file for the utmost convenience!

And I need to tell you for the last time again that msaa can still be switched with F5, between 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x.
 1x is basically off, 4x is the best middle ground, looks beautiful if it is not 1x!
 Sadly the GUI does *not* have msaa so the holy square looks jagged like a gigachad jaw.

Rusty Skylines Alpha v1.0.2a

Started to make a gui editor and advanced renderer. Lots of weird issues with the IDE, but all fine now.
The GUI is that beautiful square in the top right rn!
